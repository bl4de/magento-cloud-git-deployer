When the cloud just don't work no moe.
=====

This will delete everything except for `auth.json`, `.git` and`.magento.env.yaml` and reset your cloud project with a fresh mainline copy that is configured for the git-based workflow.


### Usage:

Run `php nuke-cloud.php` _from within your local folder containing your cloud environment git repo to be nuked_

You can exclude additional directories via the `--exclude` flag. e.g. `php nuke-cloud.php --exclude app --exclude special my-project/path`. Note that this currently can only exclude top-level directories so if you want to exclude `app/code/Magento` you have to specific `--exclude app`.

‚ö†Ô∏èüö® By default the script will use your current working directory and irreversibly delete things. **Make sure you use the right directory**. 

You may optionally provide a directory to run in: `php nuke-cloud.php my-path/to/mage-cloud`

Once the command has finished and you have run `composer update`, make sure your `.magento.env.yaml` configuration is what you want to deploy before you run `dev:git:update-composer`.
